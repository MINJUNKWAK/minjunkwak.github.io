What would be the definition of a good service?

It is a question that has been stuck in my mind since I've been making the [lettertosoldier]("https://minjunkwak.github.io/lettertosoldier/lettertosoldier-download/").

It was my first deployalbe project and at the same time, and there were real users. At the same time, there were lots of controversial opinions.

The idea, which was to send outside news to soldiers, was a great idea.

However, could the result justify the mean?

Was using "internet letter system in ROK Army" the correct approach?

Many people gave me concerns from varies areas, mostly two:

1. ROKA Training Center's perspective
2. Soldiers(Instructors) in ROKA Training Center

Firstly, taking into the ROKA Training Center's perspective, they wouldn't be supporting the program.
Just like average army in this country, the ROKATC is not the most reasonable orgnazation.

This program, or application, can send hundreds of letters with just few clicks. Which would lead to more spending on inks and papers.

I believe in freedom of journalism. And I think it was unfair for soldiers who are sacrifing their lives are blocked from freedom of information.

I believed this then, when I was in the ROKA training center, and I still believe it now.

However,I could foresee that, this could result in termination of "internet letter system" or at least slight modification to complicate the proces

Secondly, let's think about the soldiers who are duty station is ROKA Training Center.

In the process of developing this program, I had to test for the new features and bugs every time I encounter them.

I mainly sent this to one of my closest friend who was a trainee at that time.

I think I almost sent 2,000 letters.

Later, I heard that the soldier who was responsible for handing out the letter, had to do extra work to printing and cutting the letters that I sent.

After hearing this, I felt bad, beacuse I thought I was giving him the burden.

In the perspective of utilitarianism, if we sacrifice one man in each company about 10 minutes a day, which would yield one company of trainees for a better environment, it would be a success.


For last two months, the program was not functioning right. While solving the issue, I notice there was a slight change in the website structure.

I was eager to solver the issue, but I was so busy preparing for the intern interviews. (Luckly I got an offer from Google)

And I solved the issue yesterday, it seemed like the structual modification was caused by this program.

For example, there were some changes in variable names in CSS selectors. The program finds designated CSS selector to control the browser. It seems like a meaningless modification.

Also, they added an unadditional procedure when sending an letter. (which was totally meaningless as well, why would they change to process to more time-consuming and complex from simple and quick)

When I discovered the modifications, part of me thought, "may be I should stop deploying this program". This was a free distribution with zero profit and ROKATC discouraged me.

However, a comment from a stranger gave me strength to continue.

(I am having same error message from the guys below..
When are you planning to fix this issue? I am so sorry to bother you because This is a free distribution and I am not at the position to demand anything. It is just that I join next week, and this really is a useful program... Thank you)

There are people who become happy by using this program. And unfairness of ROKATC could be solved. I guess that is the motivation behind why I should contine deploying this project.

There are numerous definitions of a good service.

If I am starting my career as a software engineer. The first think I should think about making a service is users. It is not myself, nor the big companies or organizations.

If users staify and it supports the social benefit, I believe that is a good service

I hope I would be developing lots of good service thoughout my career.
