[Google Kickstart Round F]({{"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/7254486/dashboard"}})  

<img src="/assets/images/kickstart_roundf_102.png">

I've been busy since semester has started. I am taking 7 courses all related to my major and working on a new project called [lettertosoldier]({{"https://minjunkwak.github.io/blog/Letter-to-Soldier/"}}). Sometimes I wish I were a soldier.
Anyways, Round F had 12 hour limit. Comparbly long time. Thanks to the extended time limit, I had a time to grab a couple of beer between the contest. One of my friend in the army came to see me.

<h2>Problem A. Kicksort</h2>
[First Problem]({{"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/7254486/dashboard"}}) was just fine. It took me some time to find out what was I looking for.
Unfortunatey, I accidently pressed the large input button without having a full analzysis on my code, so I couldn't submit my answer.

<h2>Problem B. Dance Battle</h2>
[Second Problem]({{"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/7254486/dashboard#s=p1"}}) was an interesting problem. It took my about 5 minutes to realize that the order didn't mean anything.
From that idea, I had no problem writting the whole code.

<h2>Problem C. Catch Them All</h2>
[Third Problem]({{"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/7254486/dashboard#s=p2"}}) was the only problem that I couldn't solve. At first I thought it was a simple 'Dijkstra Algorithm'. But something keep goes wrong. I didn't have much time to look back at the code but I am planning to write it soon.

<h2>Problem D. Eat Cake</h2>
[Fourth Problem]({{"https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/7254486/dashboard#s=p3&a=2"}})was a piece of cake, simple application of dynamic programming.

Since I only missed Problem C and large case in Problem A, I placed 102th out of 488th. And placed 3rd in Republic of Korea.
I could have done better with the third problem, I was so close to making a perfect score this time. Well, at least I'm getting better.

â€» It seems like there is something wrong with the score board. If my pealty is right, I should be placed somewhere around 120th. I'll update the post as soon as the scoreboard is back.
