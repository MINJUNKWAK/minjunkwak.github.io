Three years ago, I was at Salar de Uyunni, Bolivia South America.

We woke up around 3 am in the morning to see the dawn around some salt mountain.

As we approached the salt mountain, they were about a hundred other tourists who came to see the sun go up in the white desert.

I spotted one vehicle from a distance which was a perfect aligment with the crescent above.

I took one photo with my phone and climbed up the mountain.
